# Test runner

## building the expected results files
- execute `run build` to generate mdv output for all ".md" files within this folder.
- commit


## testing new mdv versions

- travis will execute `run` to diff the current mdv output with the expected
  results


## Notes

Some day I'll make the line seps a bit smarter, e.g. min one line sep after lists
